# Project Title- Customer Water Complaint assistance tool
## Description
National Water Supply Drainage Board (NWSDB) of Sri Lanka is responsible for providing pipe born water supply service to its customers. It has been identified that reliable coordination is vital between NWSDB and customers in view of timely resolving complains on water issues such as water leaks in house connections, water main leaks, no-water issues and water meter issues, etc. Therefore this project is proposed as an assistant web application to inform water complains to the NWSDB as an alternative to presently available 1939 hotline number as well as a digital water complain management database for the NWSDB. Our web application introduced to overcome waiting time issue on 1939 hotline and error recording issues when registering a complain over the phone. 
Expected learning outcome of this project is getting hands on experience on followings;
1.	PyCharm /Visual studio code -    To create a convenient environment for productive Python, web and data science development   
2.	Django, flask               -   Python-based web framework
